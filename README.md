# CarRaceAsync

This is my first program using asynchronous programming.
The programm is a race simulation with events.

Use the global variables to change tick and time per tick.


## Introduction to the code

 - **StartRace** Initiates all the tasks and keep track of the program.
 - **Tick** Iterates through the simulation.
 - **CarStatus** Prints the current state of the race to console.
 - **Race** Updates car data and initiates event.
 - **EventRoll** Randomizes event that impacts unique car during the race.
